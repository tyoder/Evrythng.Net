Evrythng.Net
============

A wrapper for the Evrythng API written in C#

This wrapper was created using .NET version 4.5.  Much of the Json serialization and deserialization is done using the latest version of Json.Net.

To run the unit tests and console application included in this Visual Studio solution, you must obtain an API Key from Evrythng.

How to get started with an API key, etc:  https://dev.evrythng.com/documentation/start

The console application and the test project both contain app.config files.  When you have your own key, place your API key in the appropriate node of the config files.

This project currently includes the ability to operate on Thngs, including the Properties and Locations of a Thng.  Not yet included are Products and Collections, which I will work on next.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to work on this project with me.
